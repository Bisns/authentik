## authentik configuration

To support the integration of Ironclad with authentik, you need to create a property mapping, and an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create a property mapping

First name, last name

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **SAML Provider** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Temporarily set the **ACS URL** to `https://temp.temp`
        - Set **Audience** to `https://ironcladapp.com`
        - Under **Advanced protocol settings**, set an available signing certificate.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

## Ironclad configuration

1. Write first step here...

2. Continue with steps....

## Configuration verification

Template sentence that you can typically use here: "To confirm that authentik is properly configured with `<service-name>`, log out and log back in via authentik."

If there are more specific validation methods for the Service (e.g., clicking a button), include these instructions for clarity.
