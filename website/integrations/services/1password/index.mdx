## authentik configuration

To support the integration of 1Password with authentik, you need to create an application/provider pair in authentik.

### Create an application and provider in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with Provider** to create an application and provider pair. (Alternatively you can first create a provider separately, then create the application and connect it with the provider.)

    - **Application**: provide a descriptive name, an optional group for the type of application, the policy engine mode, and optional UI settings.
    - **Choose a Provider type**: select **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** as the provider type.
    - **Configure the Provider**: provide a name (or accept the auto-provided name), the authorization flow to use for this provider, and the following required configurations.
        - Note the **Client ID**,**Client Secret**, and **slug** values because they will be required later.
        - Set a `Strict` redirect URI to `https://TEMP`.
        - Select any available signing key.
    - **Configure Bindings** _(optional)_: you can create a [binding](/docs/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/bindings/) (policy, group, or user) to manage the listing and access to applications on a user's **My applications** page.

3. Click **Submit** to save the new application and provider.

### Setup automated user provisioning in authentik _(optional)_

Optionally, you can configure automated user provisioning from authentik to 1Password. This enables you to create users and groups, manage access, and suspend 1Password users with authentik.

To support automated user provisioning, you need to create a group, and a SCIM provider in authentik. This SCIM provider is the connected to the **1Password SCIM Bridge**. For more information, see the [1Password SCIM Documentation](https://support.1password.com/scim/).

#### Create a user group in authentik

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Directory** > **Groups** and click **Create**.
3. Set a name for the group (e.g. `1Password Users`), and click **Create**.
4. Click the name of the newly created group and navigate to the **Users** tab.
5. Click **Add existing user**, select the user that needs Wazuh admin access and click **Add**.

#### Create a SCIM provider

1. Log in to authentik as an admin, and open the authentik Admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Providers** and click **Create**

## Configuration verification

To verify that authentik is properly integrated with 1Password, first sign out of your account. Then, navigate to the [1Password login page](https://my.1password.com/signin), enter an email thatâ€™s provisioned for SSO, and click **Sign in with authentik**. You will then be redirected to authentik for authentication before being sent back to the 1Password dashboard.
